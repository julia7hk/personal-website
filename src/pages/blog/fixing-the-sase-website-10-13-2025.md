Fall break, accidentally fell asleep too early and now im awake

doing miscellaneous shenanigans like the sase website

leo originally told me to let him know during winter break

but i figured i could do it now so why not!

the [`sasepurdue.com`](http://sasepurdue.com) domain currently gives


main focus is the `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`

happens when the secure connection is not secure ðŸ˜”

something is wrong in between with:

1. the SSL certificate is not valid
    1. check with ssl checker ([https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html))
    2. checked, certificate is valid. NOT the problem
2. check the hosting service


double check both [`https://sasepurdue.com`](https://sasepurdue.com) and `http://sasepurdue.com` 

(matter of the secure certificate part)

`http://` one automatically redirects to the `https://` one

check ip address by doing `ping sasepurdue.com` 

```jsx
 ~ ping sasepurdue.com
PING sasepurdue.com (198.57.151.178): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 198.57.151.178: icmp_seq=0 ttl=50 time=43.081 ms
64 bytes from 198.57.151.178: icmp_seq=1 ttl=50 time=45.531 ms
64 bytes from 198.57.151.178: icmp_seq=2 ttl=50 time=41.739 ms
64 bytes from 198.57.151.178: icmp_seq=3 ttl=50 time=39.358 ms
^C
--- sasepurdue.com ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 39.358/42.427/45.531/2.234 ms
```

so the ip address is `198.57.151.178` 

but it looks correct on namecheap domain purchasing site and hostgator serversâ€¦

double check [`sasepurdue.com`](http://sasepurdue.com) on my phone

it works..?

run `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder` 

clears DNS things on your computer

problem resolved ! ðŸ˜­

now weâ€™re faced with



wow a site called [`https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/`](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/register.hostgator.com) exists

pretty cool

checkout [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) to see what was supposed to be hosted cuz i cant seem to find anything anywhere about what used to be on here

the [`https://sasepurdue.com/wp-login`](https://sasepurdue.com/wp-login) or [`https://sasepurdue.com/wp-login.php`](https://sasepurdue.com/wp-login.php) both dont work. give a 404 error

sidequest: learning wordpress

Your website lives in a **folder on your server**, usually something like `public_html` or `www`:

```
/public_html
  â”œâ”€ wp-admin/       (admin dashboard files)
  â”œâ”€ wp-content/     (themes, plugins, uploads)
  â”œâ”€ wp-includes/    (core WordPress files)
  â”œâ”€ wp-config.php   (connects WordPress to the database)
  â”œâ”€ wp-login.php    (login page)
  â””â”€ index.php       (main entry file)

```

- If **`wp-login.php` is missing**, you cannot log in.
- If **`wp-config.php` is wrong**, the site canâ€™t talk to the database.

go to hostgator file manager

( [hostgator.com](http://hostgator.com) â€”> sasepurdue site â€”> quick links includes a file manager button )

a `/public_html` directory exists! but idk if it has the right files..

it lowk doesnt have anything except a default template, favicon, etc. no wonder the website shows the default thing

go to hostgator wordpress database???

( [hostgator.com](http://hostgator.com) â€”> sasepurdue site â€”> quick links includes a phpmyadmin button )

no databases :/ not much else to do here

# ok new website time lol

in the meantimeâ€¦ organizing the sase email

- namecheap: where we purchased the domain name
- hostgator: website hosting
- wordpress: website content
    - jetpack: wordpress plugin
    - elementor: wordpress plugin
