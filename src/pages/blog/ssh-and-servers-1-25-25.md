    - config file

        - Host names
        - User usernames
        - Keychain
            - contains every password, ssh key, wifi password, etc. that ive ever used
                
    - ssh key
    - ssh key pub (paste this into wherever to ssh into there (ex. data.cs.purdue.edu)
    - known hosts (list of servers you have ssh-ed into before)
        - every time you ssh into a server for the first time you are prompted to
- oracle oc06 ssh
    - add ip address with ‚Äòsudo nano ~/etc/home‚Äô
- [data.cs.purdue.edu](http://data.cs.purdue.edu) ssh
    - pinging [data.cs.purdue.edu](http://data.cs.purdue.edu) to find the ip address
    - add ip address with sudo ~/etc/homes
