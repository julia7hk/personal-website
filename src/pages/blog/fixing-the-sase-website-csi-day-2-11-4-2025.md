3am sidenote: use **wayback machine !**

12:30pm 

i got an email on the sase gmail for an update from wix???

so it seems like we used to have a wix site 🤔

but we dont have any login credentials for it

did forgot password, got into the wix account

stalking the inbox

yo wix sucks why does it take so goddamn long to load an inbox 

(it never loaded)

what happened was there were some problems with the sase wix account having ownership of the `pusase` site

ok!!! i got over this by transferring ownership to me (julia7hk@gmail.com) and then back to sase LOL

to resolve, i transferred ownership to my personal email temporarily, then accepted it from my personal account, then transferred back to sase wix account.

now everything works!

here are the inbox notifs i see

unpublished the wix site because we dont to mislead people
