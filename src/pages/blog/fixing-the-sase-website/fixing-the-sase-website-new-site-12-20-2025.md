we are finallyyy getting to this

its winter breakkkk waow

ok…

where were we…?

lets go revisit the sase website ig

interesting thing to notice is that the `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` cant provide a secure connection error is back

![SSL error screenshot](/blog-images/fixing-the-sase-website-new-site/image.png)

i ran the `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder` command and that fixed it again tho


![Website after DNS flush](/blog-images/fixing-the-sase-website-new-site/image%201.png)

ok what do i even do from here now lol

even the links on this outdated page are broken and redirect somewhere else

so maybe i look into what hostgator is supposed to do…? ????? idk

---

i dont think we have a cpanel (control panel)

…lol

JK I LIED IT JUST TOOK FOREVER TO LOAD 😭

there are two buttons to press for 

1. “If you are not behind a firewall that blocks port 2083”

this one loads for eternity but then eventually loads into 

![cPanel login page](/blog-images/fixing-the-sase-website-new-site/image%202.png)

but i have no idea what the login credentials might be

and

2. “If you are behind a firewall and can not connect to port 2083”

after clicking this one, 

[`https://cpanel.sasepurdue.com/](https://cpanel.sasepurdue.com/)``  gives 404 error lol

so probably not this

---

ok lets log into hostgator using sasepurdue’s credentials

i just logged in cuz i was trying to find the cpanel username to log in

but then i noticed 

![Expired SSL certificate](/blog-images/fixing-the-sase-website-new-site/image%203.png)

our ssl security certificate is expired

which i didnt know hostgator didnt do automatically for us??

im pretty sure cloudflare does that automatically for my website…

---

ok lowk im getting fed up with this

and im not even really sure why we’re using hostgator

like why cant we just use cloudflare

a little bit of googling seems to agree with me

and this hostgator thing is so damn old

---

ok switch gears cuz i cant do ts

### wordpress

- cms
- no coding necessary

| wordpress.com | wordpress.org |
| --- | --- |
| use wordpress’s hosting | self hosting, self building |
|  | download the software urself |

we want wordpress.org^^

(i think)

---

ok more research

switching off hostgator and going to cloudflare wouldnt solve our problems

cuz cloudflare cant host wordpress

🥀

---

maybe i should do a side project on doing a wordpress site first…

another day !
