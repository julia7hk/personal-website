writing up this blog because i want to add my git command aliases to the oc03 server

first, figure out which shell you’re using

```jsx
echo $SHELL
```

tells you if you’re using bash or zsh

oc03 is bash

therefore, edit the `.bashrc` file

add the aliases you want to the file (somewhere at the bottom is fine)

```jsx
alias gst='git status'
alias gfo='git fetch origin'
```

save the file and reload the terminal

now it works ^^
